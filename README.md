## Quick Description

This is a WordPress site running on AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) utilizing the official WordPress Docker image. The site is backed by an RDS MySQL database, with sensitive information securely managed through AWS Secrets Manager. To enhance performance and scalability, a CloudFront CDN is set up in front of the ECS cluster's Application Load Balancer (ALB), optimizing content delivery and reducing latency.

### Bastion

I created a lightweight bastion host primarily for accessing the MySQL database to update values and troubleshoot issues.

**Future Improvements:**

I would automate configuration using a user-data script to install necessary tools like SSM Session Manager and MySQL client. Iâ€™d also enhance monitoring by enabling detailed CloudWatch metrics and alarms for better observability. Key rotation would be implemented to ensure security best practices.

### Cloudfront

I set up a CloudFront distribution in front of the ECS cluster's ALB to enhance the performance of the WordPress application by leveraging caching and reducing latency. For content-heavy platforms like WordPress, fast delivery of assets is crucial for user experience.

**Future Improvements:**

I would focus on designing a well-optimized caching strategy to ensure assets are delivered as quickly as possible, including automating cache invalidation during deployments or general updates. My next priority would be implementing AWS WAF to enhance security by protecting against threats like SQL injection attempts and other common attacks.
